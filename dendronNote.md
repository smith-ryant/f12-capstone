# Introduction:

`Hello everyone,`

My name is Ryan Smith, and today I'm excited to present to you my capstone project for Foudations 12, an "Airplane Viewer" application.

This project is a demonstration of full-stack application development, utilizing some of the most effective modern technologies to create a seamless and interactive user experience.

# Technical Overview:

At the core of this application lie three key technologies: Axios, Express.js, and Supabase. Axios, a powerful library for handling HTTP requests, integrates seamlessly with Express.js, our backend framework.

This combination allows for efficient management of network requests and responses.

Express.js serves as the backbone of our application, routing requests and orchestrating interactions between the frontend and our database.

For the database, I chose to leverage Supabase, an open-source alternative with a tremendous amount of flexibility when it comes to application expansion. Supabase uses PostgreSQL, offering robust features and reliability, making it an excellent choice for real-time data handling and operations.

# Functionality and Features:

As I finish writing my code you will notice I have started two servers, one for the application functionality and one for my seed file.

The application kicks off with a seed file that contains detailed information on five different aircraft.

This initial data populates our database with essential details like the nNumber, make, model, price and images, setting the stage for user interaction.

You noticed that the database was empty, and here I am using the Postman application to execute my seed.js file and populate the database with the data from the 5 aircraft.

Users can engage with the application in several impactful ways. The first functionality is the ability to add new aircraft entries through a user-friendly form.

This form demands specific details about the aircraft, ensuring that our database remains rich with informative and precise data.

Each entry enhances the overall database, making the app more valuable for every user.

Another crucial functionality is the ability to delete aircraft records.

This feature is vital for maintaining the databaseâ€™s relevance and accuracy as certain aircraft become obsolete or are no longer a part of the appllication.

Perhaps the most engaging feature is the image viewing capability.

When a user clicks on an aircraft image, it doesn't redirect them to another page.

Instead, the image opens in a modal window directly within the application.

This modal enhances user engagement by providing a smooth interactive experience without leaving the context of the application.

# Conclusion:

To conclude, the Airplane Viewer app, while straightforward, represents a robust integration of front-end and back-end technologies.

It was designed to highlight the power of full-stack development and the seamless integration of various software technologies.

This project has been a significant part of my learning journey, reinforcing my skills in software development and system design.

I want to acknowledge both Matt and Nitin for their unwavering support and insight. You guys have been great, and I look forward to working with you in the future.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Thanks for your time!
